Ransidble is a utility that enables you to execute [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) commands on remote hosts. It functions as a wrapper over Ansible, allowing users to launch playbooks, roles, and tasks remotely. This is achieved by exposing a REST API in front of Ansible, facilitating the execution of Ansible commands on remote hosts.
